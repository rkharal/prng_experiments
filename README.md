 microbenchmark experiments related to PRNG usage

 Experiments related to PRNG usage in microbenchmarks experiements for testing
 conconurrent data structures.

 This repository contains the following:
 
 - various PRNGs to test with in random.h

 - an nth-bit summation test program to test for patterns in the n-th bit positions of random numbers

 - scripts to run experiments

 - plot scripts to automate plot generation for visualizing summation results.
