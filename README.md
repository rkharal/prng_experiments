# PRNG_EXPERIMENTS
Experiments related to PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generator) usage in microbenchmarks experiements for testing
 conconurrent data structures.

 We test and compare various PRNGs (Hardware and Software) for use in concurrent data structure experiments.
 We also test the set of generated random numbers for randomness quality in varying bit positions of the random number.
 This gives an indication of the bitwise random behaviour generated by different PRNGs.

 Work related to PRNG Experiments (Section 6) from this work is shared in this repository.

 This repository contains the following:
 
 - various PRNGs to test with in random.h

 - an nth-bit summation test program to test for patterns in the n-th bit positions of random numbers

 - scripts to run experiments

 - plot scripts to automate plot generation for visualizing summation results

# Build Instructions:

   - clone this repository
   - All executables exist in the bin directory. We generate one exe for each PRNG
   - To rebuild the various PRNG executables:
      - see Makefile in src directory 
      - For example: g++ -o ../bin/mm3_rng run_rng.cpp -DMURMUR3 -mrdrnd -mrdseed



# Usage: 
## To Test a Pre-Generated Array of Random Numbers:




## To Compare Bitwise Randomness:
